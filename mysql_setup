step 1: download the mysql
step 2: execute the below query:
#create the db "seed_hibernate"
 create database seed_hibernate;
 
#create the user: hr1  password:hr1
create user 'hr1@localhost' identified by 'hr1';

#link user with db
grant all privileges on seed_hibernate.* to 'hr1@localhost';
        
@access the db:seed_hibernate
use seed_hibernate;


repeat the same step as previous demo:
only you need to update the configuration
